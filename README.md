# üáµüá≠ The Philippine Flood Control Fund Scandal: An Interactive Infographic

An interactive web-infographic and spending simulator that visualizes the immense scale of public funds allocated for flood control in the Philippines. This project aims to educate and raise awareness about the impact of corruption and budget misuse on the daily lives of Filipinos.

This single-page application allows users to simulate how a **‚Ç±100 Billion budget** can be spent, contrasting the procurement of luxury goods with the funding of essential government services. It serves as a tool for public accountability and a call for better governance.

## üéØ About The Project

The core of this project is a "what-if" scenario. What if you had control over a massive public works budget? Would you spend it on yourself, or on the services the public desperately needs?

This app provides two modes:
* **Nepo Baby Mode**: Simulate spending the budget on luxury items, from designer bags and supercars to private jets.
* **Taxpayer Mode**: Allocate the budget to real, impactful government projects sourced from national expenditure programs, such as building classrooms, funding health stations, and supporting farmers.

As you spend, a real-time analysis sidebar shows you the staggering equivalencies‚Äîhow many life-saving dialysis sessions or daily wages your luxury purchase could have funded.
